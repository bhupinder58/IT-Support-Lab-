# 🛠️ IT Support Lab


Welcome to my **Home Lab Documentation Project** – a curated collection of notes, guides, and troubleshooting tickets I’ve built while exploring and maintaining my own lab environment.  

This repository serves as a **living knowledge base** for:  
- 🛠️ Building & upgrading hardware  
- 🌐 Networking basics & configurations  
- 🐞 Troubleshooting real-world issues  
- 💿 Windows installation & setup
